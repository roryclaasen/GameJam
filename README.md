# GameJam ("Prison" Escape)

A top-down rpg involving anxiety

## Conclusion

So the 48 hours are up and well, honestly the game is not a game.
I tried to finish but came upon may errors and problems.
There is no end game state (just a crash)

## Next steps

I want to (start from scratch and) continue the development cobining some of the themes and ideas from the other games submited for this jam
